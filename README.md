# Introduction

traVRsal offers a number of challenging room-scale experiences allowing for constant natural locomotion without the need to teleport or use thumb sticks.

# Installation

The easiest way to install is through SideQuest. An alternative is to sideload the APK of the latest GitHub release directly.

 * [SideQuest App Page](https://sdq.st/a-449)

Hint: For better immersion it is recommendable to either reduce the Guardian sensitivity or set some padding in the settings of traVRsal so that it will not pop up.

## Using Custom Gallery Images

The gallery supports two modes:

 * Unsplash: loads the latest amazing photos live from Unsplash.com
 * Device: loads png and jpg images from your device
 
 The path where to store images on the device depends on the device:
 
 * Oculus Quest: Android\data\com.wetzold.travrsal\files\UserImages
 * PC: C:\Users\YOURUSER\AppData\LocalLow\Wetzold Studios\traVRsal\UserImages
