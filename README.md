# Introduction

traVRsal offers a number of challenging room-scale experiences allowing for constant natural locomotion without the need to teleport or use thumb sticks.

# Installation

Get it on App Lab or through SideQuest! A PC version for Rift can be found on the GitHub release page.

* [App Lab](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3381040775329400/)
* [SideQuest](https://sdq.st/a-449)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/WetzoldStudios/traVRsal/releases)

Hint: For better immersion it is recommendable to either **reduce the Guardian sensitivity** or set some padding in the settings of traVRsal so that it will not pop up.
