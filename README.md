# Introduction

traVRsal offers a number of challenging room-scale experiences allowing for constant natural locomotion without the need to teleport or use thumb sticks.

# Installation

The easiest way to install is through SideQuest. An alternative is to sideload the APK of the latest GitHub release directly.

 * [SideQuest App Page](https://sdq.st/a-449)

Hint: For better immersion it is recommendable to either **reduce the Guardian sensitivity** or set some padding in the settings of traVRsal so that it will not pop up.
